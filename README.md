# nextflow_workflow
I have written countless bioinformatics pipelines over the years, mostly using Bash scripting to organize program and alanysis flow (using programs/packages/libraries that I, or others, have written in C/C++, Perl,R,Python,Bash itself, or even MATLAB). These pipelines i would generally organize to submit on various job scheduling software (PBS/Torque, Slurm, etc.) on HPC (High perfomance computing) clusters.
I have found, recently, that Nextflow offers a well-organized, easy-to-use approach to crafting pipelines and employing containerized software dependencies (obviating many of the problems associated with versioning issues that often plague the bioinformatics and computational biology worlds).

Here we have an example where I (as many other computational biologists and bioinformaticians have organized their countless scripts over the years according to function or project.

Using the Nextflow architecture, we can create and organize workflows based on these scripts to enhance code reusability and portability (e.g. among collaboraters or across systems)
Here I present my own end-to-end RNA-Seq analysis Nextflow workflow, using the publicly available Mus musculus RNA-Seq data from the now-classic "A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Analysis of RNA Sequencing Data" (PMID: 29624415) - USA, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) Accession PRJNA450151 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA450151)
